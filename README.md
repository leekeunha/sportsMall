Hi everyone. I am keunha, Lee from South of Korea.

The project attached is a frontend project that the data is from json file. It is made with angular 9 and typescript along with bootstrap 4 library.
I planed it by referencing the world famous sports shopping mall which is Nike. It is not finished yet but still in progress. Therefore I will update the project whenever I add new features.

If you have any question or advice, please contact to leetoya2@naver.com
Thanks

- To implement the project

To implement the project, it requires two command prompts.

First one is for RESTful web service. To start the RESTful web service, open a command prompt and run the following command in the installed folder: "npm run json"
Then, open a second command prompt and run the following command in the folder to start the development tools and HTTP server: "ng serve --open"
